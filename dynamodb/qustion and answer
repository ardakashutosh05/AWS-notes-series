1. Basic Concepts

Q1: What is DynamoDB?
ðŸ‘‰ Fully managed NoSQL database by AWS, providing key-value and document data structures with low-latency performance.

Q2: What is a Partition Key?
ðŸ‘‰ The primary key attribute used to distribute data across partitions. Each partition key must be unique unless combined with a Sort Key.

Q3: What is a Sort Key?
ðŸ‘‰ The second part of a composite primary key. Allows multiple items with the same partition key but different sort keys.

Q4: Difference between Partition Key only and Partition + Sort Key?
ðŸ‘‰ Partition Key only â†’ unique key per item.
ðŸ‘‰ Partition + Sort Key â†’ allows 1-to-many relationship within partition.

2. Query vs Scan

Q1: Difference between Query and Scan?
ðŸ‘‰ Query â†’ fetch items using partition key, efficient.
ðŸ‘‰ Scan â†’ reads entire table, applies filter afterward, costly.

Q2: When to use Scan?
ðŸ‘‰ When partition key is unknown, e.g., analytics across the table.

Q3: Can Scan affect performance?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, reads all items â†’ high RCU consumption.

3. RCU & WCU (Capacity Units)

Q1: What is RCU?
ðŸ‘‰ Read Capacity Unit = 1 strongly consistent read per second for 4 KB item.

Q2: What is WCU?
ðŸ‘‰ Write Capacity Unit = 1 write per second for 1 KB item.

Q3: Difference between On-Demand & Provisioned Capacity?
ðŸ‘‰ On-Demand â†’ pay per request, no RCU/WCU config.
ðŸ‘‰ Provisioned â†’ specify RCU/WCU, can use auto scaling.

4. Indexes
Local Secondary Index (LSI)

Q1: What is LSI?
ðŸ‘‰ Alternate sort key for the same partition key. Allows multiple query patterns within a partition.

Q2: How many LSIs per table?
ðŸ‘‰ Maximum 5.

Q3: Can you add LSI later?
ðŸ‘‰ No, must define at table creation.

Q4: LSI vs GSI?
ðŸ‘‰ LSI â†’ same partition key, strong consistency, different sort key.
ðŸ‘‰ GSI â†’ different partition key, eventual consistency, can add anytime.

Global Secondary Index (GSI)

Q1: What is GSI?
ðŸ‘‰ Index with different partition key (and optional sort key) to query data not based on tableâ€™s primary key.

Q2: How many GSIs per table?
ðŸ‘‰ Maximum 20.

Q3: Can you create GSI after table creation?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, anytime.

5. Point-in-Time Recovery & Backup

Q1: What is PITR?
ðŸ‘‰ Continuous backup allowing restoration to any second in last 35 days.

Q2: PITR vs On-Demand Backup?
ðŸ‘‰ PITR â†’ automatic, rolling 35-day window.
ðŸ‘‰ On-Demand â†’ manual snapshot, retained until deleted.

Q3: Can PITR overwrite existing table?
ðŸ‘‰ No, creates a new table during restore.

6. Global Tables

Q1: What are Global Tables?
ðŸ‘‰ Multi-region replicated tables supporting active-active read/write.

Q2: How does conflict resolution work?
ðŸ‘‰ Last Writer Wins (based on timestamp).

Q3: Use case of Global Tables?
ðŸ‘‰ Low-latency global access, disaster recovery, high availability.

Q4: Maximum regions?
ðŸ‘‰ Up to 5 regions.

7. Export/Import to S3

Q1: Why export DynamoDB to S3?
ðŸ‘‰ Backup, analytics, or integration with data lake/ETL pipelines.

Q2: Can import overwrite an existing table?
ðŸ‘‰ No, imports always create a new table.

Q3: Supported formats?
ðŸ‘‰ Parquet or DynamoDB JSON.

8. Deleting Tables

Q1: How to delete a table?
ðŸ‘‰ aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name <TableName> or via Console.

Q2: Are indexes deleted automatically?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, LSIs and GSIs are deleted.

Q3: Does PITR get disabled automatically?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes.

Q4: Can you recover deleted table?
ðŸ‘‰ Only from backups or exported data.

9. DynamoDB Best Practices (Interview Points)

Prefer Query over Scan for production workloads.

Enable PITR for critical tables.

Use Global Tables for multi-region applications.

Use Indexes (LSI/GSI) only for required access patterns.

Monitor RCU/WCU usage to optimize cost.

Keep item size small to reduce capacity consumption.
