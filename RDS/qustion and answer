ðŸ”¹ Amazon Aurora Interview Q&A
Q1: What is Amazon Aurora? How is it different from RDS?

ðŸ‘‰ Aurora is a fully managed relational DB compatible with MySQL/PostgreSQL. Unlike RDS, Aurora separates compute & storage, offers 5x MySQL / 3x PostgreSQL performance, and auto-scales storage up to 128TB.

Q2: How does Aurora achieve high availability?

ðŸ‘‰ It replicates 6 copies of data across 3 Availability Zones. Even if 2 copies fail, DB continues to function.

Q3: Can Aurora be Multi-AZ?

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, Aurora is always Multi-AZ by design because storage is distributed across 3 AZs.

Q4: How many read replicas can Aurora support?

ðŸ‘‰ Aurora supports up to 15 replicas per cluster.

Q5: How does Aurora handle failover?

ðŸ‘‰ If writer node fails, Aurora promotes a replica to be the new writer automatically within 30 seconds typically.

ðŸ”¹ Aurora Endpoints Interview Q&A
Q6: What are the different Aurora Endpoints?

ðŸ‘‰

Writer endpoint â€“ Handles all write operations.

Reader endpoint â€“ Load balances across all replicas.

Instance endpoint â€“ Connect to a specific DB instance.

Custom endpoint â€“ User-defined group of instances.

Q7: Why do we need Reader endpoint?

ðŸ‘‰ To distribute read workloads across replicas automatically without app-side load balancing.

Q8: When to use Instance vs Custom Endpoint?

ðŸ‘‰

Instance â†’ When app must connect to one specific instance.

Custom â†’ When grouping specific replicas for reporting/analytics.

ðŸ”¹ Aurora Read Replica Q&A
Q9: What is an Aurora Read Replica?

ðŸ‘‰ A replica that shares the same storage as writer, providing low-latency read scaling.

Q10: Difference between Aurora Read Replica and RDS Read Replica?

ðŸ‘‰

Aurora: Shared storage, near real-time replication.

RDS: Async replication over network, may have lag.

Q11: Can Aurora replicas be promoted?

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, Aurora replicas can be promoted to standalone instances or to writer role during failover.

ðŸ”¹ Delete Aurora Database / Replica Q&A
Q12: What happens when you delete Aurora DB cluster?

ðŸ‘‰ The cluster and instances are removed. Option to create a final snapshot for future recovery.

Q13: Why is it recommended to create a final snapshot before deletion?

ðŸ‘‰ To restore database later in case of accidental deletion or requirement rollback.

Q14: Should you delete replicas before deleting the primary cluster?

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, always delete read replicas first to avoid dependency issues.

ðŸ”¹ Cross-Region Read Replica Q&A
Q15: What is Aurora Cross-Region Replica?

ðŸ‘‰ A read replica located in another AWS region, used for disaster recovery and global low-latency access.

Q16: Difference between Multi-AZ and Cross-Region replica?

ðŸ‘‰

Multi-AZ â†’ High availability within same region.

Cross-region replica â†’ Disaster recovery & global users in different regions.

Q17: Can you promote a cross-region replica?

ðŸ‘‰ Yes, in case of regional outage, you can promote it to a standalone cluster.

ðŸ”¹ Parameter Groups Q&A
Q18: What is a Parameter Group in RDS/Aurora?

ðŸ‘‰ A collection of engine configuration values applied to DB instances (like max_connections, query_cache_size).

Q19: Can you modify the default parameter group?

ðŸ‘‰ No, must create a custom parameter group to apply changes.

Q20: Which parameter changes require reboot?

ðŸ‘‰ Static parameters require reboot, while dynamic parameters apply immediately.

Q21: Real example of parameter group usage in Aurora?

ðŸ‘‰ Increasing max_connections to handle more app traffic.
