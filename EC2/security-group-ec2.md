ðŸ“˜ What is a Security Group?

Security Group (SG) = virtual firewall for EC2 instances.

Controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

Stateful â†’ if you allow inbound traffic, the response is automatically allowed outbound.

Can be applied to one or multiple instances.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Stateful: Return traffic automatically allowed.

Allow rules only: No deny rules; deny by default.

Multiple SGs per instance: Up to 5 per instance (soft limit).

Dynamic rules: Changes take effect immediately.

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step: Create Security Group

Go to EC2 Dashboard â†’ Security Groups â†’ Create Security Group

Name & Description: e.g., web-sg

VPC Selection: Choose VPC

Inbound Rules:

SSH (22) â†’ My IP

HTTP (80) â†’ 0.0.0.0/0

HTTPS (443) â†’ 0.0.0.0/0

Outbound Rules: By default â†’ All traffic allowed

Attach Security Group

During instance launch or modify an existing instance

ðŸ”¹ Example
Type	Protocol	Port Range	Source
SSH	TCP	22	203.0.113.25/32
HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0
HTTPS	TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0
ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

Restrict SSH/RDP access to specific IPs

Use separate SGs for web, app, database layers

Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 for sensitive ports in production

Tag security groups for easy management

Monitor traffic with VPC Flow Logs

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Q&A

Q1: What is a Security Group?
ðŸ‘‰ Virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

Q2: Is a Security Group stateful or stateless?
ðŸ‘‰ Stateful â€“ response traffic is automatically allowed.

Q3: Difference between Security Group and NACL?

SG â†’ instance-level, stateful, allows only allow rules

NACL â†’ subnet-level, stateless, supports allow & deny rules

Q4: Can you modify Security Group rules for a running instance?
ðŸ‘‰ Yes, changes take effect immediately.

Q5: How many Security Groups can you attach per instance?
ðŸ‘‰ Default soft limit: 5 (can request increase)

Q6: Best practices for Security Groups?
ðŸ‘‰ Restrict SSH/RDP, separate SGs per layer, avoid 0.0.0.0/0 for sensitive ports, monitor with Flow Logs.
