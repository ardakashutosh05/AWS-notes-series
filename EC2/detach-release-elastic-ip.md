ðŸ“˜ What is Detaching and Releasing an Elastic IP?

Detach: Remove Elastic IP from an EC2 instance without deleting it.

Release: Return Elastic IP to AWS so it can be used by others.

Use detaching when moving EIP to another instance.

Use releasing when the EIP is no longer needed to avoid charges.

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step: Detach Elastic IP

Go to EC2 Dashboard â†’ Network & Security â†’ Elastic IPs

Select the Elastic IP currently associated

Click Actions â†’ Disassociate Elastic IP

Confirm disassociation

Elastic IP is now unattached and can be reassociated with another instance

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step: Release Elastic IP

After detaching, select Elastic IP

Click Actions â†’ Release Elastic IP

Confirm release

The IP is now returned to AWS pool and will no longer belong to your account

ðŸ”¹ Example Scenario

Web server EC2 instance i-0abcd1234 has EIP 54.123.45.67

You want to move the IP to a new instance:

Disassociate from old instance

Associate with new instance

If you no longer need it â†’ Release EIP to avoid charges

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

Always detach before releasing

Avoid releasing EIPs if you plan to reuse them (hard to get same IP back)

Monitor Elastic IP usage to control costs

Document which IPs are associated to avoid accidental release

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Q&A

ðŸ‘‰ Select EIP â†’ Actions â†’ Disassociate â†’ Confirm.

Q2: How do you release an Elastic IP?
ðŸ‘‰ After detaching, select EIP â†’ Actions â†’ Release â†’ Confirm.

Q3: Will releasing an EIP cost anything?
ðŸ‘‰ No, but you are charged if the EIP was allocated but not associated with a running instance.

Q4: Can you reuse a released Elastic IP?
