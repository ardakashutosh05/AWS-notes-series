ðŸ“˜ What is an EC2 Instance Type?

An EC2 instance type defines the hardware configuration of an EC2 instance.

Determines:

CPU (vCPUs)

Memory (RAM)

Storage type and size

Network performance

Selecting the right instance type is critical for performance and cost optimization.

ðŸ”¹ Categories of EC2 Instance Types
Category	Purpose / Use Case
General Purpose	Balanced CPU, memory, network (e.g., t2, t3, m5)
Compute Optimized	High CPU workloads like batch processing, gaming (c5, c6g)
Memory Optimized	High memory workloads like databases, caches (r5, x1e)
Storage Optimized	High I/O and storage workloads (i3, d2)
Accelerated Computing / GPU	ML, AI, graphics workloads (p3, g4)
ðŸ”¹ Example: Common Instance Types
Instance Type	vCPU	RAM	Use Case
t2.micro	1	1 GB	Free tier, small apps, dev/test
t3.medium	2	4 GB	General purpose workloads
c5.large	2	4 GB	Compute-intensive tasks
r5.large	2	16 GB	Memory-intensive tasks
ðŸ”¹ Choosing the Right Instance Type

Analyze workload requirements: CPU, memory, storage, network

Use burstable instances (t2/t3) for intermittent workloads

Use compute optimized (c5/c6) for high CPU usage

Use memory optimized (r5/x1) for databases and caching

Consider cost vs performance

Monitor with CloudWatch â†’ scale up/down as needed

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

Start with smaller instance types â†’ scale as needed

Use Auto Scaling for dynamic workloads

Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads to save cost

Use Spot Instances for fault-tolerant, short-term workloads

Monitor CPU, memory, network usage to optimize costs
